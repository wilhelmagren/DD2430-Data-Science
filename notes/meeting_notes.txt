Should we look at correlations between EOG channels activity and MEG channels in order to determine blinking artifacts? or do you know a better way?
(artifacts from both ECG and EOG, ICA. Don’t use ECG/EOG in feature analysis, but keep them as ground truth to verify features)

Are the MAG and GRAD channels in some way appended together to create the 306 MEG channels? (Loading the data with MNE-python 
and printing info shows that there are 102 MAG and 204 GRAD channels) 
(magnetometer, gradometer, MAG kännsligare för djupare signaler, MAG risk för mer brus, mindre brus=GRAD)

Do you think there are any channels that are more important than others? E.g. how relevant is it to look at EOG or STIM channels?  
(inget STIM)

Do you know any good preprocessing techniques for this data in order to reduce potential noise? We are thinking about following preprocessing 
from a paper (Hubert Banville), where they low pass filter the data at 30Hz and downsample even more to 100Hz.
(DONT FILTER OR DOWNSAMPLE)
